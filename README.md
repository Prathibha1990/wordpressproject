Make the WordPress site as High available as possible if you got time, use
whatever AWS service as you see fit?
and
You can assume some/all AWS services are already started manually and
running, or start/configure them from within the playbook?

# ec2.yml
Here's an updated playbook that launches an EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling Group for high availability, 
and sets up a load balancer with an RDS database for WordPress.

Here's a README.md file that documents the assumptions made in the playbook:

Deployment of highly available WordPress on AWS EC2 using Ansible
Assumptions
A fresh EC2 instance running Linux is already up and running on AWS.
The following AWS services are already started and running: VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, Key Pairs, and ELB.
The EC2 instance is able to access the internet to download the latest version of WordPress.
The AWS CLI is installed and configured on the local machine where the playbook is executed.
An IAM user with sufficient permissions to manage EC2, ASG, ELB, and VPC resources has been created.
The wp-config.php file is already created and stored in the same directory as the playbook.

**Usage**

Clone the repository or download the playbook.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the playbook is stored.
Run the following command to execute the playbook:
Copy code
ansible-playbook ec2.yml
Wait for the playbook to complete the execution, which typically takes a few minutes.
Access the WordPress site using the URL provided by the ELB.
